The code is in the table.rb
It introduce a RMUData module. In this module, there is 2 classes:ArrayIndexByStr and Table.

Table is the main data structure. ArrayIndexByStr is used for associating the index with the header in the data rows.

The key difference of ArrayIndexByStr and Array is that when ["id"] raise the TypeError, it will try to find the correct index by using @header.find_index("id"), then it use this index to find the element again.

In the table class, all the data is saved in @input_data and @header. All operations are taken on these 2 instance varialbes.
